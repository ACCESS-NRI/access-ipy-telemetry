# intake-telemetry

In order to load this correctly within a Jupyter notebook (registering telemetry calls for all cells, not just after the execution of the first cell), it will be necessary to use an IPython startup script.
See sample script below:

```python
try:
    from intake_telemetry import capture_datastore_searches
    from IPython import get_ipython

    get_ipython().events.register("shell_initialized", capture_datastore_searches)
    print("Intake telemetry extension loaded")
except ImportError:
    print("Intake telemetry extension not loaded")
```

This needs to be added to the system config for ipython, or it can be added to your user config (`~/.ipython/profile_default/startup/`) for testing. See [Ipython documentation](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/intro.html#systemwide-configuration) for more information.

## Credits

This package was created with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) and the [`audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage) project template.# General Repository Template

A general template repository for default settings when creating new repositories.

This repository uses the Apache-2.0 license. `COPYRIGHT.txt` contains a current copyright statement which should be included at the top of all files.

When creating a new repository you [can use this repository as a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template), to automate the creation of the correct license and COPYRIGHT statement.

## COPYRIGHT Header

Best practice suggests adding a copyright statement at the top of every source code file, or text file where it is possible to add a copyright statement without interfering with the purpose of the file. The reasoning is if a file is separated from the repository in which it resides then it may not be possible to ascertain it's licensing, which may hamper re-use.

Making this as short and concise as possible reduces the overhead in including such a copyright statement. To that end using [SPDX identifiers](https://spdx.dev/ids/) is simple, efficient, portable and machine-readable.

### Examples

An example, short, copyright statement is reproduced below, as it might appear in different coding languages. Copy and add to files as appropriate: 

#### plaintext
It is common to include copyright statements at the bottom of a text document or website page
```text
Â© 2022 ACCESS-NRI and contributors. See the top-level COPYRIGHT file for details. 
SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

#### python
For code it is more common to include the copyright in a comment at the top
```python
# Copyright 2022 ACCESS-NRI and contributors. See the top-level COPYRIGHT file for details.
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

#### shell
```bash
# Copyright 2022 ACCESS-NRI and contributors. See the top-level COPYRIGHT file for details.
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

##### FORTRAN
```fortran
! Copyright 2022 ACCESS-NRI and contributors. See the top-level COPYRIGHT file for details.
! SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

#### C/C++ 
```c
// Copyright 2022 ACCESS-NRI and contributors. See the top-level COPYRIGHT file for details.
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

### Notes

Note that the date is the first time the project is created. 

The date signifies the year from which the copyright notice applies. **NEVER** replace with a later year, only ever add later years or a year range. 

It is not necessary to include subsequent years in the copyright statement at all unless updates have been made at a later time, and even then it is largely discretionary: they are not necessary as copyright is contingent on the lifespan of copyright holder +50 years as per the [Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention).
