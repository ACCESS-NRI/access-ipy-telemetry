# intake-telemetry

In order to load this correctly within a Jupyter notebook (registering telemetry calls for all cells, not just after the execution of the first cell), it will be necessary to use an IPython startup script.
See sample script below:

```python
try:
    from intake_telemetry import capture_datastore_searches
    from IPython import get_ipython

    get_ipython().events.register("shell_initialized", capture_datastore_searches)
    print("Intake telemetry extension loaded")
except ImportError:
    print("Intake telemetry extension not loaded")
```

This needs to be added to the system config for ipython, or it can be added to your user config (`~/.ipython/profile_default/startup/`) for testing. See [Ipython documentation](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/intro.html#systemwide-configuration) for more information.

### Notes

Note that the date is the first time the project is created. 

The date signifies the year from which the copyright notice applies. **NEVER** replace with a later year, only ever add later years or a year range. 

It is not necessary to include subsequent years in the copyright statement at all unless updates have been made at a later time, and even then it is largely discretionary: they are not necessary as copyright is contingent on the lifespan of copyright holder +50 years as per the [Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention).
